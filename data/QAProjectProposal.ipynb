    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic (or Wegovy), formally known as semaglutide, have increase 400 % in popularity between 2021 and 2023, especially in US southern states. Marketed as a drug for diabetes, these drugs are injectable methods of releasing a hormone used to slow down digestion, thus limiting the hunger a person feels. The supression of hunger leads to weightloss, however, these drugs can result in many unfortunate side effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The most common side effects of semaglutide include \"nausea, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting\" and can lessen over time, however, up to 10% of patients do not expereince lesser side effects, forcing them to stop recieving the medicaiton. Intensinal tissues connect the abdomen and brain, thus prolonged side-effects from taking the drug can cause paitents to feel extreme anxiety and depression. More extreme side effects include \"thyroid tumors, pancreatitis, changes in vision, hypoglycemia, gallbladder issues, kidney failure and cancer\" where pancreatitis and gallbladder issues... can lead to hospitalization\". The long term side effects of these drugs is still uknown.\n",
    "#### Citations: (Ozempic in America), (Medzerian), (Ozempic Side Effects Could Lead to Hospitalization â€” and Doctors Warn That Long-Term Impacts Remain Unknown - CBS News)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal Explanation\n",
    "#### Using the API key from openFDA, I have retrieved data pertaining to adverse event reports for semaglutide, which inlcudes pateint age, weight, country of origin, seriousness of side effect (including hospitalization and death), and the date of which this occured. Alternative research has shown that pateint characteristics (such as age, previous illness, etc.) impact ones likeliness to expereince side effects of any drug, and the severity of said side effects. With this data I hope to better understand the following:\n",
    "#### 1. Are drug adverse events more common in older patients who take semaglutide drugs?\n",
    "#### 2. Is there a correlation to weight and an occurence of a drug adverse event for those taking semaglutide?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I will be able to analyze the correlation of age and weight to the severity of the drug effect, which could in the future, be used to create a predictive model alogrithm using linear regression. I could then use this model to estimate the likelihood of an individual experiencing side effects, and if so, the intensity of those side effects. Further cleaning of this data is required to prusure this final iniative. Specifically, I would need to clean the patient weight data due to the presecense of many NaNs, and I would need to identify the string that corresponds to row inputs (under severity columns) that are currently denoted  with \"1, 2, 3...\" by using the reference key found on the openFDA website."
